## Script

Here there is a collection of scripts that modified files and reorganized the images. The original dataset had the wrong image size and was split into 4 folders. We put them together and removed half of the classes. All those scripts need to be run from the root dir of the project and assume the original dataset has already been downloaded. Some script require command line parameters.
