## Runs

Those are the script we ran to train and test the models. Some of them were originally notebook that have been converted via a specific python library so they still contain some structure that resembles a jupyter notebook. The scripts inside contain some hard coded hyperparameters and we were changing them directly from the files.

This is to say that the parameters inside the files were not the only ones we tested.
